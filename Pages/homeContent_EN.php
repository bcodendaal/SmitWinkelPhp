    <p>The well-established, modern practise of Drs Smit &amp; Winkel sets the pace in the latest trends and technologies in dental practise, IT and related fields. Apart from regular dental and oral hygiene, specialised cosmetic and aesthetic dentistry, CAD-CAM (Cerec) technology and implantology also form part of their service offering. 
The four dental practitioners in this northern suburbs clinic share over 90 years of experience between them. Each one diligently ensure they stay informed and at the forefront of relevant new developments.</p>
    <p>The focus in this buzzing family-oriented practise is on total oral and dental care and it is especially well known for being child-friendly. Anxious patients are also offered the benefit of conscious sedation if required.</p>
    <p>Meticulous attention is paid to a clinically safe work environment while maintaining a welcoming, stylish interior. A full time assistant ensures equipment is sterilised all through the day. And, should a power outage or water cut ensue work can continue seamlessly.</p>
    <p>Sound human relations – with patients, suppliers, the medical fraternity, staff and other stakeholders – is an uncompromised core value at Drs Smit &amp; Winkel. Patients therefore enjoy quality results, excellent after care and follow-up as a result of established relationships with physicians, maxillo-facial surgeons, orthodontists, periodontists and dental technicians. The staff complement comprises two male dentists; two female dentists; two oral hygienists; and seven supporting and administrative staff - several with many years of loyal service in the practise.</p>
    <p>Drs Smit &amp; Winkel has been operating for over twenty years and is a well-established landmark on the corner of Bill Bezuidenhout Drive and Mountainview Avenue.</p>
